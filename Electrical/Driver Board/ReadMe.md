### <p>Improvements for next revision/Testing Notes:</p>
- Increase vias on the thermal pad of the motor driver chip (U9) from 5 to 8
- R18 change value from 3.3kohm to 6.2kohm (I_limit(A) = 6600 / RCS (Î©); Equation valid range: 500 mA < I_limit < 2000 mA)
  - This limits the motor current to just over 1A. The motor was previously limited at 2A which was leading to excessive heat.
  - This value will likely need further adjustment/refining.
      - Using 5.1kohm as of 11/01/2022 for a current limit of 1.3A
- Send PWM signal going to motor driver through a buffer. 
  - The datasheet says the HIGH level of PWM for the chip is 2.7V. I'm sending it 3.3V which should be enough. Shifting that up to 5V would be best.
  - Current testing shows reliablity at 3.3V. If I re-spin this board I will still update this.
- R10 change value from 0ohm_NA to 0ohm
  - Not placing this resistor results in the processor not receiving the signal.
- Add TVS diodes to the I2C and SPI lines.
- upgrade processor to STM32F446 (or similar) for faster cycle speed
- upgrade motor driver because this one is unreliable durring startup
