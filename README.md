# HDD-Persistence-of-Vision-Clock_V4.1
Version 4.1 of my HDD Persistence of Vision Clock.

This clock uses a Dell MBE2147RC HDD heavily modified to be turned into a clock.

The PCB of the hard drive is replaced with a custom PCB. Connections are passed to another PCB mounted where the bottom platter originally is using spring-loaded header pins. The PCB mounted below the spinning light mask (top platter) holds 116 individually addressable LEDs.

The clock uses Persistence of Vision technique to create a display. Instead of spinning the light source, this clock spins a light mask. The standard slit light mask allows for an analog clock to be drawn, as well as other basic patterns.

V4.1 will implement a custom Nipkow disk light mask to allow for pixels to be displayed.
