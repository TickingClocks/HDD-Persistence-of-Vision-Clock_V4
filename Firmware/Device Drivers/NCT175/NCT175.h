 *
 *  The NTC175 is a PCB temperature sensor. The sensor has a temperature range of -55째C to +125째C
 *
 *  The sensor communicates over I2C. The sensor has 3 address setting pins. The I2C address of the
 *  device is determined by how these pins are connected.
 *
 *  There are 3 NTC175 temperature sensors in the HDD Clock V4.0.
 *  	1. Measuring the PCB temperature of the LED board (display)
 *  	2. Measuring the PCB temperature of the driver board near the buck converter circuit
 *  	3. Measuring the ambient air temperature (V4.0 this sensor was routed wrong and instead gets the
 *  											 (PCB temperature near the buttons)
